## Skills

#### Research and Problem Solving

While at university I developed my strong research and problem solving skills, in the context of laboratory work and theoretical analysis. Experiments that were largely left to the students' own initiative comprised a large part of the curriculum, in addition to a large, long-term theoretical research project.

#### Independent Learning

While at university I taught myself basic C and C++.

#### Customer Service

During my time at and after university I have acquired experience in a variety of catering roles including Rocket Food in London and a variety of pubs in London and Bristol through which I was able to gain an understanding of customer interaction, attending to requests and giving customers the best experience possible.
